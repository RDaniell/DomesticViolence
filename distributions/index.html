          <h4>Strengthening communication in New York City communities by having the latest data on domestic violence utilizing the material from NYPD, ENDGBV, and NYC Open Data. Contrary to what the media or organizations such as Remember My Name or It Starts With Us do, the aim of this project is not be to expose the identity of victims or their families, instead it will be a site which gathers data to expose particular forms of injustice such as language barriers in New York City.

            <h4>While researching information on Domestic Violence in NYC I came across a few articles discussing how a lot of victims face language barriers when trying to report their abusers and many cases are not even translated from the victim’s native language to English. In other words, many victims’ cases are abandoned and not taken care of.
            According to data from the NYPD on Domestic Violence and the Mayor’s Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence (ENDGBV) there are over 300 nonprofit organizations and city agencies in charge of domestic violence including 77 police precincts. All of these precincts are required to comply with Local Law 30 of 2017 (LL30) which requires city agencies to have a “language access coordinator, provide telephonic interpretation in at least 100 languages, translate their most commonly distributed documents into the 10 designated citywide languages,” including Spanish, Chinese, and Russian, and others. However, while analyzing the dataset many of these agencies are highlighted as if they only provide English services. Therefore, I will navigate this more in-depth by calling these locations to have the most updated information.</h4>
            
            <h3><b>Addressing the Issue</h3>

            <h4>By providing resources and interactive visualizations with the most recent data on domestic violence in NYC this project seeks to question the truthfulness of the resources and information being provided on domestic violence in NYC.</h4>
